The files in this collection contain hundreds of period 3 and 4 spaceships for
Conway's Game of Life that were found with David Eppstein's gfind program.  The
output is unedited and may contain lots of duplicates and flotillas (especially
the c2p4 files).  The files are in Life 1.05 format and should be readable by
most Life viewing programs.

A file name like c2p4g-21-00.lif means speed c/2, period 4, glide-reflect
symmetry, width 21, page 00. You get the idea (maybe).

Folders:
c2p4g - c/2, orthogonal, period 4, glide symmetric
c2p4s - c/2, orthogonal, period 4, bilateral symmetry
c3    - c/3, orthogonal, period 3
c4o   - c/4, orthogonal, period 4
